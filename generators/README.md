# Generators

Iterator is a type of object in Python giving the capability
to the developer to iterate over a list.

Iterator by nature are more complex to write
Since Python 3, you can use Generator (which are iterator)
but easier to user than recreating an Iterator.

An iterate only loads the next value to iterate over instead of loading all of the elements of the list in memory. As a result, the memory is not overwhelmed and we can process the program.
