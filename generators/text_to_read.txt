Starmer will argue that the next election is about “something deeper … than the usual competing visions” and promise that a Labour government would usher in what he describes as “a decade of national renewal”.

He will contrast this with what he claims has been the “national decline” inflicted on Britain by the Conservatives and will accuse Sunak’s party of “an entitlement to power totally unchecked by any sense of service or responsibility”, adding: “That’s the cultural stain that runs through the modern Conservative party.”

He will describe Britain as a “practical nation” but claim it is one in which people now cannot afford Christmas, where they don’t know if the ambulance they have called will come and where 6,000 crimes go unpunished every day.

“Common sense is rolling your sleeves up and solving these problems practically, not indulging in some kind of political performance art,” he will add. “This goes for stopping the boats as well. It’s not about wave machines, or armoured jetskis, or schemes like Rwanda you know will never work.


“It’s about doing the basics better. The mundane stuff. The bureaucratic stuff. Busting the backlogs. Rebuilding a functioning asylum system. Removing people more quickly so you don’t have to run up hotel bills. And a cross-border police force that can smash the smuggler gangs at source.”
